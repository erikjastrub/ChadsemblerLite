# Lightweight Chadsembler

Without the constraint of being an A-Level programming project, the Chadsembler was completely rearchitected and optimised from the ground up
Original Chadsembler: https://github.com/erikjastrub/Chadsembler

Outline:

- 40% less code than the Original Chadsembler
- Emphasis on modularisation through the use of namespaces and a better file structure
- Clear dependencies
- Much much less string manipulation, greatly improving both performance and memory efficiency
- A faster, more memory efficient and safer run time

How to Run:

To execute the main branch download the project and simply run the 'chadsembly.py' file with the source code file you want to execute!

E.g: 'py ./chadsembly.py ./code.csm'
