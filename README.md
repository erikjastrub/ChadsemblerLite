# Rust

- Install rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/)

- Verify it is installed by typing 'cargo --version' in the command line/terminal

- Download the code for the branch

- Open the command line, ensuring your current working directory is the "chadsembler" directory

- Type "cargo build --release" into the command-line/terminal

- An executable with the name 'chadsembler.exe' can then be found in chadsembler\target\release"

- This is the compiled binary/executable, enjoy!
