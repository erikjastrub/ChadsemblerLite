# Rust

- A port of the Lightweight Chadsembler, rewritten in Rust!
- Original: https://github.com/erikjastrub/Lightweight-Chadsembler/tree/main
- Rust is a compiled language making it blazingly fast!
- Rust programs are also memory safe and secure!

### Instructions

- Install rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Verify it is installed by typing 'cargo --version' in the command line/terminal
- Download the code for the branch (unzip if compressed)
- Open the command line, ensuring your current working directory is the "chadsembler" directory
- Type "cargo build --release" into the command-line/terminal
- An executable with the name 'chadsembler.exe' can then be found in chadsembler\target\release"
- This is the compiled binary/executable, enjoy!

### Version Information

- Dependent on the phf-map crate for compile time, static look up maps (https://docs.rs/phf/latest/phf/)
